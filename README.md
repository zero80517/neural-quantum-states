# neural-quantum-states

## Course assignment

Consider the approach of representing the quantum states of a spin system as states of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine
and create Coursework report.

## Programming part

Modified code from G. Carleo & Emily Davis, Kevin Fischer, and Alex Hristov
using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
